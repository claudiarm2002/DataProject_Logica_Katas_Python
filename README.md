## 📂 Project Content

The repository contains a variety of exercises designed to strengthen programming skills in Python. These exercises allow you to:
- Calculate letter frequencies in text and perform operations on numerical lists.
- Use map(), filter(), and reduce() to transform and summarize data.
- Implement functions and classes to model data structures and handle more complex logic.
- Handle user input and exceptions in a robust manner.
- Process text, compute geometric areas, and determine contextual information such as the time of day.
- Reinforce programming logic, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency with Python core features.
